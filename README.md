# Threat Detection Rules & Resources
A curated list of threat detection rule repositories and sharing communities.

This documentation is an effort to collect open source material that is useful for building basic threat detections.
To have sophisticated detections, it often takes full time detection engineers, understanding of custom environments, etc. but everyone starts somewhere. 

## Rule Type Overview
TODO: Add specifics on various detection rules & their functions for context (open source + vendor specific).
